# ðŸ“œ Cline

**Cline** is a Python package for building command line interfaces.

**Cline** is easy, quick to use, and enables unit testing. Chase that 100%, my friends!

## Example

Let's say we want to build a command line application that:

- Sums two numbers if we pass them with `--sum`
- Subtracts two numbers if we pass them with `--subtract`
- Prints the application's help if we run with `--help`
- Prints the application's version if we run with `--version`
